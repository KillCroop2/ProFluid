# ProFluid

ProFluid is a fluid simulation project that models the behavior of particles in a fluid environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/KillCroop2/ProFluid.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` bash
cd ProFluid
```

3. Compile and run the simulation:

``` bash
javac src/*.java
java -cp src FluidSimulation
```


## Project Structure

- [`FluidSimulation.java`](https://github.com/KillCroop2/ProFluid/blob/master/src/FluidSimulation.java): Contains the main fluid simulation logic.
- [`Particle.java`](https://github.com/KillCroop2/ProFluid/blob/master/src/Particle.java): Defines the properties and behaviors of individual particles used in the simulation.

## Usage

### Controls

- **Left Mouse Button**: Add fluid to the simulation.
- **Right Mouse Button**: Drag fluid around the simulation.
